# Master Writing Professional and Modern JavaScript
Take your JavaScript to the next level and find out what it's fully capable of.


## Core Coursework (take these in order)

1. [JavaScript: From Fundamentals to Functional JS, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-fundamentals-functional-v2/) : A practical introduction to JavaScript and an overview of the language, Bianca covers what you need to know to be competent at writing JavaScript.

2. [JavaScript: The Hard Parts, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-hard-parts-v2/) : Will’s course emphasizes not only understanding JavaScript, but also communicating your understanding of the language’s most important concepts. Communicating is a necessary skill for becoming a high-performing engineer.

3. [Deep JavaScript Foundations, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/deep-javascript-v3/) : Kyle’s course builds by reinforcing many of the foundational concepts covered in Will’s course, but goes even deeper. He also covers types and the type coercion that goes on under the hood of JavaScript.

4. [JavaScript: The Recent Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/js-recent-parts/) : Modern JavaScript builds on top of the foundations and adds more to the language. Kyle’s JavaScript the Recent Parts course will give you a deeper understanding those newer features added to the JavaScript Language.

5. [JavaScript: The New Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/) : Understanding asynchronous and functional programming deeply will increase your programming abilities drastically. The first course is part 2 of Will’s “Hard Parts” series. With this one, he’s focusing on the new asynchronous features in JavaScript.

6. [Functional-Light JavaScript, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/functional-javascript-v3/) : Functional programming is a set of tools such as map/reduce/filter, pure functions, and immutability. These tools are sure to make you a more effective developer through composing pure functions together to write more predictable and bug-free code.

7. [Hardcore Functional Programming in JavaScript, v2](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/hardcore-js-v2/) : There’s a push with new languages that compile to JavaScript which are born of a functional nature like Elm and PureScript. In this course, we see how far we can take pure JavaScript towards more traditional functional programming.


## Elective Coursework

We have even more optional JavaScript courses! TypeScript is increasingly becoming a standard way to add type information into the language. You’ll want to learn to be able to optimize and measure your code’s performance. The entire JavaScript language can be broken down into abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Finally, it’s good to have some techniques to debug your JavaScript.
